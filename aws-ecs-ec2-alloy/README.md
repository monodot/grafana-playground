# AWS: Send logs from an ECS task on EC2 to Grafana Cloud Logs with Grafana Alloy

This example shows how to collect logs from tasks running on ECS EC2 instances, using Grafana Alloy running as a Daemon on the VM.

## What's in this example

This example includes Terraform configuration for the following:

- An Elastic Container Service (ECS) cluster, consisting of a single EC2 VM instance

- ECS Task definition and Service for a demo app, which just writes fake HTTP logs to stdout (using `mingrammer/flog`)

- ECS Task definition and Service that runs Grafana Alloy as a daemon, mounting the Docker socket on the EC2 instance, so that Alloy can collect logs from all the containers running on the same host

- Some cloud-init "glue" to create an Grafana Alloy configuration file on the host, which is later mounted into the Alloy container

- ECS Task logs are also sent to CloudWatch, just in case you want to view the logs directly in the AWS Console, but aren't strictly needed

## To deploy

1.  Rename the file `terraform.tfvars.example` to `terraform.tfvars`, and fill in the variables with your Grafana Cloud credentials and Loki endpoint.

2.  Run the following commands:

    ```shell
    cd terraform

    terraform init

    terraform apply
    ```

After some moments you should see some Logs appear in Grafana Cloud.

## Debugging

Once the infrastructure is up and running, you can SSH into the ECS EC2 instance using [AWS Systems Manager][1] &rarr; Session Manager, if you want to inspect the configuration, e.g. `sudo docker ps` to see the running containers, or `sudo cat /etc/alloy/config.alloy` to inspect the Alloy config file.
